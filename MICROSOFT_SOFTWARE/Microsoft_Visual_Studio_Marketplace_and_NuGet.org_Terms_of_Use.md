## 📜 Section 1 & 2: Offerings and Use Rights

The document details different types of offerings and the specific rights and conditions associated with their use, particularly for the Marketplace.

### Types of Offerings

Let's visualize the hierarchy and types of offerings:

**Key Conditions for Marketplace Offerings (Section 2):**

*   **Publisher Terms of Use:** Your use of a `PublisherOffering` is governed by the Publisher's separate terms. Microsoft is not party to these.
*   **Marketplace Offering Use:** Governed by the acquisition agreement and applicable fees. Restricted to use with **In-Scope Products and Services** (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code, Azure DevOps). You cannot reverse-engineer or use them outside these products.
*   **BYOL Offerings (Bring-Your-Own-License):** You must have externally obtained rights to use these. You are responsible for ensuring you have these rights.
*   **Publisher Policies:** Publishers must comply with applicable laws for customer data. Microsoft's policies do not apply to `PublisherOfferings` or data handled by Publishers.
*   **Marketplace APIs:** Use of APIs for purchasing or accessing offerings binds you to presented terms and authorizes fee payment.

## 🚫 Section 3: General Use Rights and Prohibitions for All Offerings

This section applies to both Marketplace and NuGet offerings and highlights restrictions on how you can use the Sites.

    USER_ACTION -> NON_PUBLIC_MEANS;

Simply put: Don't misuse the Sites, harm Microsoft's infrastructure, interfere with other users, try to hack in, scrape data, or use Microsoft's own offerings incorrectly.

## 💰 Section 9: Limitation of Liability

This section significantly limits the damages you can recover from Microsoft.

**Key Limitation:**
If Microsoft breaches the agreement, or if you have any basis for recovering damages:

\text{USD\$5.00}
$$

**Damages You CANNOT Recover (to the extent permitted by law):**

*   Consequential damages
*   Lost profits
*   Special, indirect, incidental, or punitive damages

**This limitation applies regardless of:**

*   If the $5.00 remedy doesn't fully compensate for losses.
*   If Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of damages.

**Applies to anything related to the Agreement, such as:**

*   Loss of customer data.
*   Viruses from using the Sites.
*   Delays/failures in transmissions or transactions.
*   Claims for breach of contract, warranty, etc.
