## 4. Kantianism (Section 2.6) ‚öñÔ∏è

Kantianism is a duty-based ethical theory. Its cornerstone is the Categorical Imperative.

**Caption for Diagram 4.1:** This diagram details the two main formulations of Kant's Categorical Imperative as explained in Section 2.6.1. The First Formulation emphasizes universalizability ($$\forall x \text{ Maxim}(x)$$), while the Second Formulation focuses on treating humanity as an end in itself. (Source: Quinn, M. J. (2020). *Ethics for the Information Age* (8th ed.). Pearson. Section 2.6.1.)

### 4.2 Evaluating a Scenario using Kantianism (First Formulation Flow)

The text describes evaluating Carla's purchase of a term paper using Kantianism (2.6.2). The first formulation can be visualized as a decision process.

Bentham's seven attributes for weighing pleasure/pain are also noted. (Source: Quinn, M. J. (2020). *Ethics for the Information Age* (8th ed.). Pearson. Section 2.7.1.)

## 9. Morality of Breaking the Law (Section 2.12) - A Multi-Perspective Analysis üö®

title Morality of Breaking a (Just) Law (Sec 2.12)\nExample: Copying a Copyrighted CD

package "Social Contract Theory Perspective (2.12.1)" {
  object SCT_Law {
    evaluation = WRONG
    reasoning = Prima facie obligation to obey law as part of social contract. \n Copying violates copyright owner's legal rights.
  }
}

package "Kantian Perspective (2.12.2)" {
  object Kant_Law {
    evaluation = WRONG
    reasoning = Property rights (incl. IP) from implicit common agreement. \n Copying violates copyright owner's property rights; \n fails universalizability (if all copy, concept of copyright is undermined).
  }
}

package "Rule Utilitarian Perspective (2.12.3)" {
  object RuleU_Law {
    evaluation = WRONG (generally)
    reasoning = Rule "Obey the law" (if just) maximizes utility. \n Universal copying harms creators, reduces new works. \n Breaking law okay only if law unjust & breaking it leads to greater utility.
  }
}

package "Act Utilitarian Perspective (2.12.4)" {
  object ActU_Law {
    evaluation = MIGHT BE RIGHT (in specific cases)
    reasoning = Depends on specific consequences. \n Scenario: Copying for a sick, poor friend. \n Benefit_friend + Benefit_copier > Harm_industry (if no lost sale).
  }
}

note as Conclusion
  SCT, Kantianism, Rule-U generally conclude breaking a just copyright law is wrong.
  Act-U might find specific instances permissible based on consequences.
  (Quinn concludes against copying in this example for most theories.)

**Caption for Diagram 9:** This diagram summarizes how different workable ethical theories from Chapter 2 might evaluate the morality of breaking a just law, using the example of illegally copying a copyrighted CD (Section 2.12). It shows varying conclusions based on the theories' core tenets. (Source: Quinn, M. J. (2020). *Ethics for the Information Age* (8th ed.). Pearson. Section 2.12.)
