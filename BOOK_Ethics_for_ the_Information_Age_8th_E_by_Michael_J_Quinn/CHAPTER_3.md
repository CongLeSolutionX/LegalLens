**Caption for Diagram 4:** This diagram contrasts the ethical perspectives of Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill on censorship, as discussed in Section 3.6.5 of Quinn's textbook. Both philosophers largely opposed censorship, emphasizing individual reason (Kant) and the societal benefits of a free exchange of ideas (Mill). Mill's Principle of Harm is also highlighted as a criterion for justifiable government intervention. (Source: Quinn, M. J. (2020). *Ethics for the Information Age* (8th ed.). Pearson.
