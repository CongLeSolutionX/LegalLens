This chapter sets the stage by exploring the historical evolution of computing, networking, and information storage, and introduces the complex interplay between technology and society.

### 1.1 Introduction: The Dawning of the Information Age üåÖ

The introduction of Chapter 1 establishes that we are living in the **Information Age**, primarily driven by two catalysts: **low-cost computers** and **high-speed communication networks**. These have given rise to transformative technologies like smartphones and self-driving cars.

Quinn emphasizes that our relationship with technology is intricate:
*   We **create and adopt** technology.
*   Technology, once adopted, **transforms us** and our societal interactions.

These transformations can be:
*   **Physical:** Citing studies on **neuroplasticity** (e.g., London taxi drivers' hippocampi changing with experience) and how digital interactions (Web browsing, social media) can trigger dopamine releases, potentially leading to addictive behaviors.
*   **Perceptual:** The example of cell phones making users feel safer, but also more vulnerable if lost, is given. It also touches on how providing cell phones to children for safety might implicitly teach them not to rely on strangers.
*   **Social:** The **Amish** community is presented as a case study in deliberate technology adoption. Their guiding question, "Does it bring us together, or draw us apart?", exemplifies a conscious approach to integrating technology based on its impact on family and community values.

A core theme is the **dual nature of technology**:
*   **Problem Solver:** Technologies are adopted to solve problems and improve lives (e.g., advances in healthcare like CT/MRI scanners).
*   **Problem Creator:** New technologies often introduce unforeseen challenges (e.g., automobiles providing freedom but causing traffic congestion, or Waze creating new traffic issues). The Web offers vast information but also exposes children to inappropriate content.

The chapter stresses human **agency**: we have control over whether to adopt technologies (e.g., the slowdown in US nuclear power plant construction after Three Mile Island) and can influence the rate of technological development through societal structures like intellectual property laws.

The section concludes by highlighting that understanding IT's history, current issues, and ethics is crucial for making informed decisions about technology use.

	*   **HyperCard (Apple, 1987):** Stacks of "cards" with text/images, linked by "buttons." Used for games like Myst.
*   **Networked Hypertext: World Wide Web (Berners-Lee, 1989-91):**
	*   **Tim Berners-Lee (CERN):** Inspired by father's discussions of brain-like computer connections. Wrote Enquire (1980).
	*   Proposed networked hypertext system for CERN documentation (1989).
	*   Implemented on NeXT computer. **Key difference:** allowed links between information on *different*_ networked computers (built on TCP/IP).
	*   First Web browser **WorldWideWeb** (Christmas 1990), released at CERN (March 1991).
	*   **Mosaic (Univ. of Illinois):** First widely used Web browser.
*   **Search Engines (Modern Era):**
	*   Accept keywords, search database of documents (Web pages), return relevant matches.
	*   **Google:** Most popular. High precision due to **PageRank** algorithm (assumes importance/quality by how often other sites link to a page).
*   **Cloud Storage (Modern Era):**
	*   Storing data remotely on servers accessed via Internet (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud).
	*   **Benefits:** Access from multiple devices, easy sharing, automatic backups.

### 1.5 Contemporary Information Technology Issues ‚ùìü§î

Section 1.5 lists several pressing questions raised by the growth of IT, setting the stage for the rest of the book.

*   **Intellectual Property Rights:** What are reasonable rights in the digital age? How should laws adapt to easy copying (e.g., *Game of Thrones* piracy, Windows 10 for pirated copies)?
*   **Cloud Storage:** Reliability and security concerns for remotely stored data.
*   **Credit Card Information:** Balancing convenience with risks of theft (e.g., Target breach) and privacy implications of purchase tracking. Who owns transaction data?
*   **IT in Loan Applications:** Shift from personal interviews to credit bureau consultations ‚Äì advantages and disadvantages?
*   **Software Errors & Liability:** Who is liable when bugs in critical systems (e.g., traffic signals, pacemakers) cause harm or death?
*   **Employee Monitoring:** Impact of tracking calls, keystrokes, web visits, email. Does it create unacceptable stress?
*   **Telecommuting:** Advantages and disadvantages.
*   **IT Industry Decentralization & Job Shifts:** Movement of IT jobs from Silicon Valley to other global hotspots (e.g., India, China). Impact on US jobs.
*   **Labor Conditions in Tech Manufacturing:** Ethical sourcing, exemplified by criticisms of Foxconn (manufacturer for Apple, Amazon, etc.). Consumer boycotts ‚Äì effective or harmful?
*   **"Fake News" & Democracy:** Can the free exchange of information via new tech strengthen or undermine democracies?

### Summary of Chapter 1 Insights üí°

The chapter summary reinforces key takeaways:
1.  **Evolution, Not Revolution:** Most innovations are evolutionary steps building on prior work.
2.  **Long History of IT Impact:** Significant social changes from technologies like the telegraph, telephone, and radio predate PCs and the Web.
3.  **New Ethical Questions:** Rapid tech change raises many new questions testing our values.
4.  **Human Agency (Papert's Quote):** We have control over how we use technology. The key is not to predict the future but to *make* it responsibly.

### An Interview with Dalton Conley: The "Elsewhere Ethic" üì±üåç

The chapter concludes with an interview featuring sociologist Dalton Conley, who discusses his concept of the "Elsewhere Ethic."

**Key Concepts from Dalton Conley:**
*   **"Elsewhere Ethic":** A shift from the traditional imperative to "find oneself" (individualism) to a new imperative to "manage one's selves" (intravidualism). Constant connectivity blurs private/public "backstage" spaces, requiring management of multiple data streams and identities.
*   **Drivers of the Elsewhere Ethic:**
	*   Communications technology (constant connectivity).
	*   Rising income inequality and economic anxiety.
	*   Increased work-life tension (e.g., working mothers).
*   **Youth as "Digital Natives":** Often fully socialized within this new normative context, while older generations are caught between old and new ethics.
*   **Technology & Social Change Feedback Loop:** A Marxist view might say tech drives social change. Others, tech reflects social change. Conley suggests a feedback loop: tech alters the social landscape (erasing boundaries like home/office, work/leisure), but tech development also reacts to social changes (e.g., two-working-parent families needing more connectivity).
*   **No Going Back (Easily):** While a conscious choice to "drop out" is possible, it's against intense societal forces.
*   **Moving Forward - "Weisure":** Embracing the blend of work and leisure. Success lies in bending and blending boundaries, not erecting rigid ones (e.g., telecommuting, on-site daycare like Google's).
